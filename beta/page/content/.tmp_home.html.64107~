	     creates life-changing experiences.  From the students we send abroad every year, to the
	     interns we bring to Michigan to work with local companies, to our own student members 
	     making everything happen, we are creating change both at home and abroad.
	     Interestingly enough, we are only one of over 800 Local Communities around the world
	     working to do the same.
         <h1>So, What is AIESEC?</h1>
         <p>
         In over 1700 universities in 107 countries and territories, AIESEC is a global, non-political,
         independent, not-for-profit organization run by students and recent graduates of institutions
         of higher education.  Our international platform enables young people to explore and develop 
         their leadership potential for them to have a positive impact in society.
         </p>
         <p>
         AIESEC provides its members with an integrated development experience comprised of leadership 
         opportunities, international internships, and participation in a global learning environment.   
         </p>
         <h1>Another Paragraph?</h1>
         <p>
         That\'s right, with AIESEC you get an butt load of text right on the homepage.  You can read read
         the black and white goodness that is information all day without even having to click a link.
         </p>
         <p>
         That\'s because AIESEC Michigan needs to have enough text here to keep the entire left bar visible.
         Or, I could just set a minimum height for this div.  I\'m actually going to go do that right now.
