aiesecmichigan.com is the website for the University of Michigan chapter
of the student organization AIESEC.


Notes:

This project works with a mysql database.
A clean checkout of this repo will not run.  A config.php file is needed in the app/ folder, in which the following should be specified:
	host		// where the mysql database is located
	username	// mysql username with read/write access
	password	// mysql password
	db			// the mysql database used by this project
Also, the database must obviously be set up for the app to run!
