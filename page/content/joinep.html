         <h1>Join as an Exchange Participant</h1>
		 <p>
		 AIESEC Michigan can help you find the internship of your dreams almost anywhere in the world.  If you would
		 like to go abroad through AIESEC, but don't have time to join our organization, then becoming an Exchange
		 Participant is exactly what you're looking for.  After you're accepted, we'll help you through the process
		 of using our database and finding the ideal internship for you through a series of meetings and one-on-one
		 contact with one of our experienced chapter members.

		 Know you want to apply as an Exchange Participant?  
		 We generally recruit at least once per semester, so check our Announcements section or our
		 <a href = "calendar.php">Calendar</a>
		 in the bar on the left 
		 for upcoming deadlines.  We also hold several info sessions before each recruitment, and we highly encourage
		 prospective members to attend, ask questions, and find out first hand what AIESEC is all about.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Exchange Participant applicants are contacted with interview decisions a few days after the application
		 deadline, with interviews genrally scheduled for that weekend.  After interviews, candidates are emailed
