         <h2>So, what's it like going abroad through AIESEC?</h2>
		 <p>
		 Because we are an organization run entirely by student volunteers, AIESEC interns
		 experience a level of immersion not found in most exchange programs.  From the minute
		 you step off the plane, you will be completely taken care of by the students in your 
		 destination's chapter of AIESEC.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 This host chapter is just like us here at AIESEC Michigan; a group of students
		 dedicated to promoting internatioanl exchange into and out of our home countries.
		 They will help you find housing for your stay, ensure that you can commute between
		 home and work, and help you with everything you need while on your internship.  Best
		 of all, they are young college aged students just like you, excited about meeting 
		 new people, showing them around town, and having a good time.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Anything that needs to be taken care of before your host chapter can help will be
		 done by us at AIESEC Michigan, your home chapter.  You will be assigned an individual
		 experienced member to help you through the process of finding your ideal internship, 
		 applying, and handling all visa and other requirements before you leave.  We also
		 hold several sessions to help teach everyone how to use the database effectively and
		 make sure everything is going smoothly.  Soon enough after, you'll be hearing back
		 from companies about your applications and talking to your host chapter about what it
		 will be like to live in their country.

         <h2>What are the internships like?</h2>
		 <p>
		 All AIESEC internships are set up individually on a case-by-case basis for the needs
		 of the company, so each one is unique.  Length can vary anywhere from 6 weeks to
		 2 years, and location can be anywhere in our network of 107 different countries on 6
		 continents.  Some are paid, some are volunteer, and you could be working anywhere from
		 the smallest nonprofit organization to the largest multinational corporation.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Thankfully, all of this variety is managed by our online internship database.  After
		 being accepted by AIESEC Michigan, we will set you up on this database and teach you
		 how to use it at every step.  You'll be able to search for the internships that fit
		 you best, and then apply to each one individually.  Final acceptance at this stage is
		 handled entirely by the company, so requirements obviously vary depending on the job.
		 Application is done by sending a resume and cover letter, and many companies also
		 interview candidates.  From here your chances of being accepted are comparable to
		 applying to a similar job in the US based on your skills; however, many companies do
		 favor American applicants due to speaking native English.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 The types of internships that are available on the database are also incredibly varied.
		 Because the AIESEC network is so huge, chances are if you're looking for some moderately
		 specific field of work, you can find an internship to fit.  That said, some internships
		 are more plentiful than others, and availability definitely varies by region.  To help
		 in narrowing down your search, the database is divided into four main types of
		 internships.
