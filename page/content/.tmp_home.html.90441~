	     creates life-changing experiences.  From the students we send abroad every year, to the
	     interns we bring to Michigan to work with local companies, to our own student members 
	     making everything happen, we are making change happen both at home and abroad.
	     Interestingly enough, we are only one of over 800 Local Communities around the world
	     working to do the same.
