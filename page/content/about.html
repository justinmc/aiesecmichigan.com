          <h2>History of AIESEC </h2>
          <p>What began in 1948 as an organization to help develop &quot;friendly relations&quot; between 
          member countries
          is now a global association with activities in 107 different countries and territories.</p>

          <h2>AIESEC International</h2>
          <p>
          AIESEC (pronounced - eye-sek) is a French acronym that stands for Association Internationale
          des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales, or International Association of Students in Economic and Commercial Sciences. However, our focus has grown to encompass a much wider range of disciplines. AIESEC was founded in 1948 as a means to rebuild ties between the war-torn European countries in the aftermath of WWII. At that time, Europe was in a state of economic devastation and an entire generation of leaders was lost.
		  </p>
          <p>But perhaps worse than the physical damage was the hatred and bitterness that the war had produced. It was a hard time to sell the idea of cultural understanding. An organization was needed to bridge the gap, to bring the people of Europe into harmony. European students
          believed that they were charged with a responsibility to increase international understanding
          and cooperation. With this, AIESEC was given life in March, 1949 at a conference that was held
          in Stockholm, Sweden. Representatives from seven European countries: Belgium, Denmark,
          Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden officially founded AIESEC.</p>

          <h2>AIESEC US</h2>
          <p>AIESEC United States was started in 1958 at Columbia University, which later became the office<br> 
          for the National Committee. The post-WWII industrial economic boom allowed businesses to participate in new international education related programs, and AIESEC quickly spread across <br>
          the country. As the number of Local Communities grew, AIESEC United States established the <br>
          four regions: Northeast, South, Central, and West and appointed directors to oversee the <br>
          regions' operations.</p>
          <p>Today, AIESEC United States has committed itself to the increase of creating the best exchange program in the world and developing quality global leaders. We are forging into the 21 st century with 36 Local Communities who work hard to keep the original values of the organization, while facing new global challenges. </p>
          <p><em>Over the past 60 years, AIESEC has been molded and shaped by the changing world. </em></p>
