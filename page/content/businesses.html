		 Whether you're business is looking to expand into the international market, is in need of 
		 specific language skills, or is just looking for some fresh perspective, AIESEC Michigan can
		 help you find the international talent you need.  Just tell us what you're looking for and
		 we can get you resumes of bright young AIESEC members excited to come to the US.  Our
		 fifty member chapter right here in Ann Arbor will make sure they have everything they need
		 from their visa and legal paperwork to housing and a great group of friends waiting when
		 they get here.
