         <h1>What are the costs?</h1>
		 <p>
		 At AIESEC Michigan, we pride ourselves in being one of the most affordable ways for students
		 on the Michigan campus to go abroad.  Many of our internships are paid, and some even cover 
		 housing or transportation costs.  Between this and the many 
		 <a href = "funding.php">funding</a> 
		 opportunities available for students going on our internships, chances are you can make an
		 AIESEC internship work for you regardless of your financial siutation.

		 The <b>Database Fee</b> is a one time fee that is charged to you in exchange for access to our
		 internship database.  This is charged after you apply, interview, and are accepted by AIESEC
		 Michigan.  After paying the fee, you are given an account with access to our database and can
		 begin browswing our thousands of internships (with help from us, of course).
		 You will be able to continue searching and applying for internships on our database for up to
		 one year after paying the fee.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 The <b>Match Fee</b> is charged to you after you have been offered an internship through
		 AIESEC and are ready to accept the offer and go abroad.  This fee varies depending on the
		 type of internship according to the chart above (type of internship is made clear for
		 every internship on the database).
