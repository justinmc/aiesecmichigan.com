         <h1>Join as an Exchange Participant</h1>
		 <p>
		 AIESEC Michigan can help you find the internship of your dreams almost anywhere in the world.  If you would
		 like to go abroad through AIESEC, but don't have time to join our organization, then becoming an Exchange
		 Participant is exactly what you're looking for.  After you're accepted, we'll help you through the process
		 of using our database and finding the ideal internship for you through a series of meetings and one-on-one
		 contact with one of our experienced chapter members.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 If you'd like to find out exactly what it's like to go abroad with AIESEC, try our 
		 <a href = "joingoabroad.php">Going Abroad</a> 
		 section.  If you think you might like to join as a full member of our student organization, see our
		 <a href = "joinlc">Joining as a Member</a>
		 section for more information.

		 thinking about joining as a full member, you can read more and download the application on our

		 an Exchange Participant, please contact our president directly at 
		 <a href = "mailto:  michigan-president@aiesecus.org">michigan-president@aiesecus.org</a>.
