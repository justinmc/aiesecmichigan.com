      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

	  <i>How does AIESEC differ from other abroad programs?</i>
      <p>
      AIESEC does not define itself as provider of internships only. Rather, AIESEC offers you many different opportunities to discover and develop your potential. Although an internship a broad is an essential part of the experience you can gain in AIESEC, it is closely linked to other experiences rather than separated from them.

      <i>What does the AIESEC Exchange Program offer?</i>
	  <p>
      The AIESEC Exchange Program lets its participants have an intense intercultural experience as well as gain and develop professional skills.  AIESEC in your home country prepares you for the internship, while the AIESEC chapter in the receiving country helps you apply for visa, work permit and organizes your accommodation. In addition, the AIESECers and other trainees will take care of you when you arrive, introduce and familiarize you with their culture, and organize events where you can get to know other interns.

      <i>What is AIESEC NOT?</i>
	  <p>
	  AIESEC is not a long-term job placement program, study abroad program, nor does it sell its internships as a factory sells a product.  We cannot and will not cater to applicants solely interested in interning with a specific high-profile company and earning a high wage in a specific city.   Although these internships do exist in our database, finding one of them is not what AIESEC is all about.  We are much more interested in applicants interested in developing technical and soft skills while expanding their worldview through immersion in a foreign society and culture.  Each internship provides a valuable opportunity for interns to contribute meaningfully to the local society and as well as act as a learning experiences for both the company and intern.

      <i>Does AIESEC provide study abroad opportunities?</i>
	  <p>
	  No, only internships and voluntary work abroad.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>Does AIESEC provide domestic internship opportunities (in the US)?</i>
	  <p>
	  No, only internships and voluntary work abroad.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>I’m from abroad but studying in the US.  Can I participate in the Exchange Program with AIESEC US?</i>
	  <p>
	  Yes.  The only restriction imposed by AIESEC is that foreign nationals can’t go on internships to the country in which they have citizenship, as it would not classify as a cultural exchange.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>How long are AIESEC internships?</i>
	  <p>
	  AIESEC internships can range anywhere from 6 weeks to 18 months.  Voluntary internships typically last from six to eight weeks and are often ideal for applicants interested in going abroad during the summer. Educational internships have a similar 6 to 8 week time frame during the summer, but also can be done at various times in the year for a longer period of 8 to 12 months.  Management internships are rarely less than 5 months and technical internships rarely less than 6 months.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>What type of internships does AIESEC offer?</i>
	  <p>
	  AIESEC offers internships in many different areas, and we divide them into four broad categories: management internships,
	  education internships, technical internships, and volunteering abroad.  You can read more about each category on the
	  <a href = "abgoabroad.php">Go Abroad</a> page.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>Does AIESEC cover on-site accommodation?</i>
	  <p>
	  It’s the responsibility of AIESEC to arrange housing for every intern.  Home stay, apartment, and 'intern houses' are
	  all frequent arrangements.  Whether or not the 
	  intern has to pay for housing depends on the internship.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>I’m only a freshman in college and but really want to go abroad for a few months.  Is that possible?</i>
	  <p>
	  Absolutely!  College freshmen consistently report having some of the most rewarding and enriching AIESEC experiences.   Though AIESEC provides a variety of internships all year round, the majority of AIESEC internships for undergraduates take place during the summer and are 2-3 months long educational and volunteer internships.  Check with the local committee nearest to you for our latest recruitment cycle.

      <i>How can I apply for an AIESEC internship?</i>

	  who want to go abroad.  Head over to the

      <i>If I am initially accepted by AIESEC how likely is it I find an internship?</i>
	  <p>
	  Upon your acceptance, AIESEC will work closely with you to help you find a suitable internship.  If you are flexible with your country, type of work, and have good credentials it is very likely you will be successful in securing an internship with AIESEC.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>I graduated in ‘XX.  Can I volunteer or work abroad through AIESEC?</i>
	  <p>
	  Any individual currently enrolled in an institution of higher education or has graduated less than 2 years ago is eligible for AIESEC’s exchange program.  This includes masters and graduate students as well as undergraduates.  Although AIESEC United States does not discriminate based on age, the requirements of many of our international counterparts state that you must be under 30 and to take part in an AIESEC exchange.  As a result it is not likely that persons over the age of 30 will be able to take an internship through AIESEC.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>I really want to go abroad through AIESEC but am not sure where.  What countries offer the most opportunities?</i>
	  <p>
	  In our more than 50 years of existence, thousands of AIESEC US interns have interned in many of the 100+ AIESEC countries around the world.  In the recent past China, India, Turkey, Brazil, and Eastern Europe have had especially large internship pools for US students and graduates.  Most opportunities in Western Europe are long term and meant for university graduates and postgraduate students.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>Who will help me when I arrive in my host country?</i>
	  <p>
      All AIESEC internships are connected to a local committee in your host country whose purpose is to help you during your internship.  More concretely, the members of your host local committee will organize your accommodation, pick you up from the airport (or give you directions and the address of your accommodation), and accompany you to work on your first day. In addition, they will integrate you into their activities, organize events for you and the other interns and help you get to know the people and culture of their own country. If there should be any problems, they will also be your local lifeline for help.  AIESEC US will also do everything possible to repeatedly keep in contact with and support you.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>What are the costs associated with AIESEC internships?</i>
	  <p>
	  All US applicants are charged an initial nonrefundable $75 application fee upon their acceptance into AIESEC’s exchange program.  From here the applicant will work with the help of a local AIESEC chapter to apply for and be selected by an AIESEC internship of his or her choice.  Upon final confirmation of a prospective intern’s acceptance to an internship, the applicant will be charged one more “match fee” of $425 (for volunteer and educational internships) or $675 (for technical or management internships). 
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>Will I be charged the $75 application fee if I apply to AIESEC and am not accepted?</i>
	  <p>
	  No, applications for AIESEC’s Exchange Program are free of charge.  You will only be charged the application fee in the case that you’re accepted to the Exchange Program.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>What kind of experience is required to be accepted by AIESEC and, in turn, be accepted to a quality internship abroad?</i>
	  <p>
	  As AIESEC is open to an international, wide group of applicants, it’s natural that among available internships required credentials vary greatly.  Different development and educational internships will typically consider all applicants from college freshmen to graduate students.  Technical internships and management internships are typically more long term and geared towards those with work and related college-level educational and/or work experience.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>Does AIESEC have a language requirement?  Do I need to be fluent in X to go to an X-speaking country?</i>
	  <p>
	  English is the international language of AIESEC.  AIESEC members across the world will speak English, and the English language is the basis of a large number of AIESEC internships.  Because of this, proficiency in English is required to be eligible to go on most any AIESEC internship.  In Central and South America the majority of internships require proficiency in Spanish.  Those in Germany often require proficiency in German.  Additional language ability is an added bonus for multi-lingual applicants. 
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>Are AIESEC internships paid or unpaid?</i>
	  <p>
	  Aside from development internships, other types of internships (technical, educational, and management) are typically paid.  In the case of volunteer internships accommodation is covered by AIESEC.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>Will AIESEC cover my airfare?</i>
	  <p>
	  No, AIESEC does not cover airfare, though on a case by case basis it can happen that your employer will pay for your flights.
      </p>
	  <br>
      <i>How much will the trip cost overall?</i>
	  <p>
	  There are many factors that go into overall cost including international health insurance, visa, vaccinations (if necessary), airfare, cost of life in your host country, and many other things.  For this reason the figure is hard to ball park a general figure; clearer estimates can be given after acceptance to AIESEC at the time of application for a specific internship.
