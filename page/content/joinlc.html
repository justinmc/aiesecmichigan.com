		 <p>
		 Our chapter is divided into the following five teams that each play their own part in running the organization
		 and facilitating exchange into and out of Michigan:
		 </p>
		 <br><br>
		 <h2>Business Development</h2>
		 <p>
		 The Business Development team builds and fosters relationships with members of the business community in the 
		 greater Detroit area. In doing this we generate leads that result in corporate partnerships, ideally creating 
		 amazing internships and traineeships to bring young individuals into Michigan and the US for the experience of 
		 a lifetime!  Driven, ambitious students with a knack for communicating and the ability to think on their feet 
		 do well on our team. Go BD!

		 <h2>Outgoing Exchange</h2>
		 <p>
		 Outgoing exchange sends students abroad through AIESEC Michigan.  We work to connect students with international
		 internships, ranging from educational and developmental internships to technical and management internships.  
		 Each member is responsible for a number of students each semester who they work closely with in order to find 
		 an internship that works for them!  It is a personal side of AIESEC in which members can directly influence 
		 the lives of students on campus.

		 <h2>External Relations</h2>
		 <p>
		 External Relations is the face of AIESEC Michigan on campus.  We are responsible for our marketing and the 
		 image of AIESEC, which means we also handle all the technical work of the chapter like web and graphic design.  
		 We're also the main point of contact for our relations with faculty and staff of the University as well as for 
		 our huge network of alumni.  Technical people, creative people, and people with great social and networking 
		 abilities excel on our large and diverse team.

		 <h2>Finance and Logistics</h2>
		 <p>
		 Finance and Logistics handles all financial aspects of AIESEC  Michigan. This team is for any student who is 
		 interested in accounting, finance, or any technical aspect of a student organization. Being a member of finance 
		 and logistics provides a great 
		 opportunity to learn the inner workings of how AIESEC operates. They maintain the account balance locally and 
         nationally, determine project budgets, prepare monthly finance updates, provide finance-logistical support to other teams, and organize 
		 room and vehicle reservations.

		 <h2>Talent Management</h2>
		 <p>
		 The Talent Management team focuses on increasing member involvement and retention by developing 
		 holistic skills, providing direction, and inspiring members to 
         reach their potential. The team handles a three-step process: recruitment, newbie training, and
         member development. The team manages the recruitment process, runs the mentorship program, and 
         offers opportunities to bring value to AIESEC membership. Mentorship pairs newbies with an 
         experienced member, a personal connection as well as support and direction to reach leadership 
         potential. Team members utilize the skills gained from their previous teams to think outside the 
         box to further the development of the chapter.

		 <h2>The application process</h2>
		 <p>
		 Have you decided to apply to our chapter as a full member?  
		 We generally recruit at least once per semester, so check our Announcements section or our
		 <a href = "calendar.php">Calendar</a>
		 in the bar on the left 
		 for upcoming deadlines.  We also hold several info sessions before each recruitment, and we highly encourage
		 prospective members to attend, ask questions, and find out first hand what AIESEC is all about.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Member applicants are contacted with interview decisions a few days after the application deadline, with
		 interviews generally scheduled for that weekend.  After interviews, candidates are selected for a second
		 round group interview event usually held the following week.  Candidates are then emailed shortly afterwards
		 with final decisions on acceptance to AIESEC Michigan.  Good luck!
