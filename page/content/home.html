	     creates life-changing experiences.  From the students we send abroad every year, to the
	     interns we bring to Michigan to work with local companies, to our own student members 
	     making everything happen, we are creating change both at home and abroad.
	     Interestingly enough, we are only one of over 800 Local Communities around the world
	     working to do the same.

         <h1>So what is AIESEC?</h1>
         <p>
         In over 1700 universities in 107 countries and territories, AIESEC is a global, non-political,
         independent, not-for-profit organization run by students and recent graduates of institutions
         of higher education.  Each of our chapters around the world is working to spread diversity and improve humankind's
		 potential by partnering with local businesses who need international talent, as well as sending
		 our own members abroad on these internships at other chapters around the world.
		 </p>
         <p>
         For our interns, AIESEC provides the best in jobs, accomodation, and support, all set up by
		 other college students around the globe.  For businesses, we provide top talent from anywhere in
		 the world, and the assurance that these interns are taken care of and having the time of their lives.  And for our members, 
		 AIESEC provides access the largest global network you're likely to find as a student, the opportunity to 
		 develop as a leader of tomorrow through our initiatives and leadership roles at every level,
		 and most of all the chance to make a real difference as we work to make the world a more
		 better place.
         </p>
